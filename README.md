# AirCanvas
Air Canvas is an interactive computer vision application that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures captured by a Raspberry Pi camera. The application tracks hand movements and specific finger gestures to create a virtual drawing experience without physical touch or keyboard interaction.
AirCanvas was developed and tested using RPI5 with M.2 HAT+ AI Accelerator and picamera module 3 hardware.
